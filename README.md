# Project Distribution Network Infrastructure

This is my second network project â€“ a medium-sized distribution network infrastructure created in Cisco Packet Tracer.

The project was developed as part of my preparation for **CCNA I: Introduction to Networks**.

## Documentation

The documentation is available in two languages:

- [English version](en/README.en.md)
